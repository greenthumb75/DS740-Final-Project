# University of Wisconsin: DS740-Final-Project - Customer Churn Prediction Analysis
The data set contains 91,698 observations, 1 response variable (CHURN), 34 predictor variables, and a column for customer ID number.  I have considered several methods to predict churn (customer loss) using the 34 predictor variables, or a subset of predictor variables. 

# Methods
Decision trees with Random forests with 10-fold cross-validation for tuning number of trees.
Artificial Neural Networks with 10-fold cross-validation for tuning the number of hidden layers and the decay rate parameters.
